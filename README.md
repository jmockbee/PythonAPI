# Python API
This is a Python API as the name implies and it will be using Docker.

This documentation will be a linear time line showing steps. 

### Step 1 
Create python file main.py and your virtual environment.

In the terminal type py -3  -m venv <name>
I named this one venv
In the command pallet of VScode pick your venv interpreter

You can also type .\venv\Scripts\python.exe in the command pallet for the same results.

To activate bat in terminal type venv\Scripts\activate.bat
you will then see (venv) C:\Users on the left side of the terminal when you press enter . This mean your virtual environment is activated.
